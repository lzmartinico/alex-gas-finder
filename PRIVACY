The Gas Finder Alexa skill requests user permissions only to provide information about the gas station around you.
This information is NOT stored by the developer, and it is NOT sent to ANY third party for the purposes of advertisement, data gathering and analytics or any other such practices, with the exception of JSsolutions.ca, which provides the stations location data and price information through the mygasfeed.com API, and Amazon.com, which provides the Alexa speech recognition software, and hosts the skill as part of their web services. 
The developer assumes no responsability for how JSsolutions.ca or Amazon.com handle this potentially sensitive data. 
Both companies may additionally be retaining user information such as IP addresses and usage logs.
Users who may be cautious of how their location data is used may not want to add their full address in the Alexa app settings, or may refuse to grant permission to the skill.
Not granting location permission to the skill will the result in the user not being able to make use of the services provided by the skill until location permissions are enabled
