The Gas Finder Alexa skill requests user permissions only to provide information about the gas station around you. This information is NOT stored by the developer, and it is NOT sent to ANY third party for the purposes of advertisement, data gathering and analytics or any other such means, with the exception of JSsolutions.ca, which provides the stations location data and price information through the mygasfeed.com API, and Amazon.com, which provides the Alexa speech recognition software, and hosts the skill as part of their web services. The developer assumes no responsability for how JSsolutions.ca or Amazon.com handle this potentially sensitive data. Both companies may additionally be retaining user information such as IP addresses and usage logs.
